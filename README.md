# VuAlta Consulting – Static Site

This repository now holds a **fully static HTML/CSS website**. All JavaScript frameworks and build tooling have been removed.

## Usage

* Simply open `index.html` in a browser, or serve the folder with any static file server.
* For GitHub Pages, push the contents of this repo to your repository and configure Pages to serve from the `main` branch (root). The site will be available at `https://<your-user>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

No build step or Node.js is required.
